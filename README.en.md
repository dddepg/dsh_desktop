**A ready-to-use desktop client for DeepSeek Harness (Windows / macOS)**

Ships the full dsh runtime and official plugins — no Node.js install required, double-click to run

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🎉 v0.5.0 — Full architecture migration & rewrite**: the desktop shell has moved from Electron to **Tauri 2 (Rust)** — more stable, better to use:
> smaller installers, lower memory, faster startup; the "guardian waterfall" keeps the app **openable even with broken plugins / configs**.
> User data is fully compatible with the old version — install over the top for a painless upgrade (see the [upgrade guide](dsh-tauri/docs/upgrade-guide.md) and [Architecture](#-architecture)).
> Pre-v0.5.0 Electron builds remain available on [Releases](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases); only the Tauri architecture is maintained from now on.

## ✨ Features

### Zero Setup

- **No dependencies** — bundles a standalone Node runtime and npm CLI; the target machine needs nothing extra
- **Complete dsh** — full `@deepseek-ai/dsh` package with all official plugins, works offline
- **One-click launch** — double-click to start `dsh web`, reuses the last saved port, then loads into a native window
- **Two flavors** — Portable (no install, USB-friendly) + Installer (desktop/Start Menu shortcuts)

### Experience

- **Frameless glass window** — custom title bar with Win11 rounded corners; closing hides to the system tray
- **Desktop pet** — a little whale companion that stays on your desktop (toggle in Settings → Plugins)
- **Side session popup** — spin up an independent session window anytime, without disturbing the main one
- **Session management** — archive / restore / delete conversations; history never piles up
- **Balance widget** — real-time "this turn cost · balance" in the conversation stats bar, with OpenCode Go quota support; click to top up
- **Completion notifications** — Windows notification when an agent task finishes; click to return to the window

### Resilience

- **Guardian waterfall** — the kernel boot chain self-heals level by level: broken plugins auto-repair, corrupt configs rebuild, crash loops restart in place; no incompatible state ever exits the app (core v0.5.0 Tauri feature)
- **Crash self-healing** — renderer freezes detected via heartbeat and auto-reload; the supervisor probes the kernel and relaunches with backoff
- **History compatibility** — session event vocabulary is patched automatically so third-party plugin events never break history loading
- **Auto update** — in-app client update check & install from the ⋯ menu (dual-source GitHub/Gitee Releases with automatic failover, sha256-verified fail-closed, silent when offline); upgrades reinstall to the old location with zero config loss; the kernel ships with the client (no separate update chain)
- **Shortcut self-healing** — desktop and Start Menu shortcuts are recreated automatically when missing

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Requirements**: Windows 10 / 11 (x64). No pre-installed Node.js or any other runtime. (Linux / macOS builds and the portable flavor have shipped from v0.5.1 on — the 0.5.x line publishes as prereleases via the CI pipeline; grab them on the [Releases](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases) page.)

> [!NOTE]
> **The table below points to pre-v0.5.0 Electron builds** (the last Electron line was 0.4.x). **From v0.5.0 the app runs on the Tauri architecture** — v0.5.0 (released 2026-08-21) ships a Windows x64 NSIS installer:
> [`DSH.Desktop_0.5.0_x64-setup.exe`](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases/download/v0.5.0/DSH.Desktop_0.5.0_x64-setup.exe) (~87 MB, `currentUser` mode needs no admin, WebView2 bootstrapper embedded).
> Newer v0.5.x prereleases (v0.5.2, 2026-08-22, fixes the reboot-loop / white-screen issues reported on v0.5.1) are on the Releases page.
> Installing it over any legacy Electron build (0.1.x–0.4.x) relocates to the old directory, keeps all data, and requires zero manual migration (see the [upgrade guide](dsh-tauri/docs/upgrade-guide.md)).

### International users (GitHub)

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases) hosts the complete single-file installers with no size limit — download directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read before you download — the answer is in the file name:**
>
> - **`win-` = Windows, `macos-` = macOS** (`.exe` is always Windows; `.dmg` / `.zip` is always macOS);
> - **`x64` = Intel/AMD chip, `arm64` = ARM chip** (Windows ARM devices like Surface Pro X and Apple Silicon Macs pick arm64; everything else picks x64).
>
> Pick yours:

| Your device | Download |
| --- | --- |
| 💻 Windows PC (most Intel/AMD) | `DSH-Desktop-<version>-win-portable-x64.exe` (no install, double-click to run) or `-win-setup-x64.exe` (installer with shortcuts) |
| 🪟 Windows ARM (e.g. Surface Pro X) | `DSH-Desktop-<version>-win-portable-arm64.exe` |
| 🍎 Mac Intel | `DSH-Desktop-<version>-macos-x64.dmg` |
| 🍏 Mac Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) | `DSH-Desktop-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` |

The macOS build is not code-signed yet — on Apple Silicon, the first launch shows "cannot verify developer". **Right-click the app → Open**, or run:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/DSH Desktop.app"
```

### China users (Gitee)

> [!NOTE]
> The Gitee mirror currently tops out at **Electron v0.4.1** — the v0.5.0 (Tauri) installer is not mirrored there yet; please download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases) for now.

Gitee caps files at 100 MB, so Electron installers are split into parts (`.part1/.part2/...`). Download all parts, then double-click the `merge.bat` attached to that release to merge them automatically, and verify with `SHA256SUMS`. Pick your version on the [Gitee Releases](https://gitee.com/my-yang-yunfan/dsh_desktop/releases) page.

**Gitee parts keep the legacy naming** (no `win-` prefix, e.g. `...-portable-x64.exe.part1`) — different from the GitHub naming, but merging works the same. macOS installers are not mirrored to Gitee — download them from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/myYangyunfan/dsh_desktop/releases).

**Data location**: Windows portable keeps data in `data\` next to the exe; the installer uses `%APPDATA%\DSH Desktop\`; macOS uses `~/Library/Application Support/DSH Desktop/`. Set the `DSH_HOME` environment variable to override the dsh config directory.

## 🛠 Build from Source

For v0.5.0 (Tauri architecture) — prerequisites: the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and `dsh-desktop/` having had `npm install` (the kernel payload source):

```bash
# Tests (full Rust suite + sidecar)
cd dsh-tauri
cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml
node --test sidecar/cli.test.js

# Dev run
cd src-tauri/src/app && cargo run

# Package the win-x64 NSIS installer + installed-layout smoke test
bash dsh-tauri/scripts/stage-payload.sh
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli build --config src-tauri/src/app/tauri.conf.json \
  --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
bash dsh-tauri/scripts/smoke-installed.sh
```

See the [development manual §6](dsh-tauri/docs/development.md) for the full flow (incl. debug switches like `DSH_TAURI_DIAG` / `DSH_TAURI_DEVTOOLS`).

## 🤖 Releases

From v0.5.0, releases go through the **Tauri GitHub Actions cloud pipeline** ([`tauri-release.yml`](.github/workflows/tauri-release.yml)): pushing a `v*` tag triggers three-platform builds (unified vendor node v24.15.0 + full `stage-payload.sh` + fail-fast compat build), then collects the artifacts into a Release automatically. **v0.5.0 was published by this pipeline** (2026-08-21; this round shipped the Windows x64 NSIS installer). **From v0.5.1 the full three-platform asset set (Windows installer/portable, Linux AppImage/deb, macOS dmg) passed verification and publishes as prereleases on the 0.5.x line**; v0.5.2 (2026-08-22) fixes the issues users reported on v0.5.1. The Electron-era `release.yml` pipeline was retired along with the architecture. For manual local packaging outside CI, see [Build from Source](#-build-from-source) above (stage-payload → tauri build → installed-layout smoke, three steps).

### 📦 Installer formats the Tauri architecture can export

Controlled by `bundle.targets` in `tauri.conf.json` — add or remove entries to extend the output formats:

| Platform | Format | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows x64 | **NSIS installer** (`DSH.Desktop_<version>_x64-setup.exe`) — LZMA-compressed, ~87 MB measured; `currentUser` mode needs no admin rights; WebView2 bootstrapper embedded so offline machines can install too; upgrade chain reinstalls into the old directory, keeping data | ✅ **Shipped in v0.5.0** (CI-built, passes installed-layout smoke test) |
| Windows arm64 | NSIS installer (cross-build with `--target aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`) | 🔜 Natively supported by Tauri, not yet validated |
| Windows | MSI (WiX toolchain, add `"msi"` to `targets`) | 🔜 Natively supported by Tauri, not yet enabled |
| Linux x64 | `.AppImage` / `.deb` | ✅ Produced by CI from v0.5.1 (six-asset verification, prerelease line) |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `.app` / `.dmg` disk images | ✅ Produced by CI from v0.5.1 (ad-hoc signature verified, prerelease line) |

> A no-install portable build is not a built-in Tauri target — the Tauri line defaults to the NSIS `currentUser` installer, and a standalone portable package is planned for a later release.

## 🏗 Architecture

**From v0.5.0 the app runs on the Tauri 2 (Rust) architecture** — the Electron shell has been retired; its full set of responsibilities (windows / IPC / updates / packaging) is re-implemented crate by crate on the Rust side, contract-first (`dsh-tauri/contracts/` — five hard contracts are the single source of truth for interfaces):

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Tauri 2 shell (Rust · 7 one-way-dependency crates)      │
│  · supervisor: boot guardian waterfall → spawn kernel    │
│    → readiness swap → liveness probe → crash-loop        │
│      in-place restart (never a blank window)             │
│  · shell-core        paths / settings (self-heal) /      │
│                     single instance                      │
│  · kernel-process    spawn spec / ready line / Job       │
│                     Object tree-kill                     │
│  · bridge            Electron IPC 43 channels → Tauri    │
│                     commands, full mapping + shim JS     │
│                     (window.dshDesktop)                  │
│  · fence / preview-server / session-watcher /            │
│    sidecar-orchestrator (boot sequencing + Node sidecar  │
│    reusing dsh-desktop/scripts kernel logic, zero        │
│    rewrite)                                              │
└──────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┘
                       │  dsh web --host 127.0.0.1 --port <reused port>
                       ▼
            Bundled node + @deepseek-ai/dsh
            Path resolution: user overlay > bundled package
                       │  ready-line detection
                       ▼
            Native window loads Web UI (localhost only)
```

Layering rules: crates never depend on the tauri runtime and are independently unit-tested (177 Rust tests green; plus 16 sidecar Node tests across 71 shared-script unit files); the assembly root only wires things up; kernel-side Node logic lives in `dsh-desktop/scripts/`. See the [development manual](dsh-tauri/docs/development.md).
